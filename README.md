# **pocketixng**
A block- and form-based visual programming editor for smart home automation built for Angular [Try it out](https://pocketixng.iot.petr-john.cz/)!

## **Overview**
**pocketixng** is part of the broader **Pocketix** project — a visual programming language (VPL) designed for automating IoT and smart home devices. It enables users to design automation flows through drag-and-drop blocks and configurable forms, making it approachable for non-programmers.

Originally developed in collaboration with [Logimic](https://www.logimic.com/cs/) for the project *Services for Water Management and Monitoring Systems in Retention Basins*, the editor continues under development by [Petr John](https://www.fit.vut.cz/person/ijohn/.en) and [Jiří Hynek](https://www.fit.vut.cz/person/hynek/.en) at [BUT FIT](https://www.fit.vut.cz/.en).
